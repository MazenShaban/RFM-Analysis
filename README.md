# RFM-Analysis
Use the technique of Recency - Frequency - Monetary (RFM) Analysis to cluster customers into segmentations based on their purchasing habits,
where:
- *Recency* --> Indicates the time passed from a customer's last purchase.
- *Frequency* --> Indicates the number of times a customer purchased.
- *Monetary* --> Indicates the amount of money a customer has spent.
